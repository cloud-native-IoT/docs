# Namespaces Management

Here you can find all namespaces you have rights(at least READ) to.

## First look

![Namespace Table](Images/namespaces/table.jpg?raw=true)

As you can see whole page, except [**Create namespace**](#create-namespace) button, is just a table.

By the first sight it consists of 3 columns:

  1. Namespace Name - **Mark 5**
  2. ID - **Mark 6**
  3. Actions - **Marks 7, 8. 9, 10**

What's more complicated, that's these rows can have various states:

1. Default **Mark 1**
2. Editable **Mark 2**
3. Expanded **Mark 3**

## Default Mode

In this mode you can just enter [**Edit mode**](#edit-mode)(**Mark 7**) and Delete(**Mark 8**) Namespace

## Edit Mode

In this mode you can rename namespace by editing name in textbox(**Mark 11**) and saving it by clicking Save button(**Mark 9**). If you don't want to apply changes tp the name, click Cancel button(**Mark 10**)

## Expanded Mode(access rights editor)

By clicking on Expand Icon(**Mark 4**) or anywhere on the row, except buttons, you can expand access rights editor.
Which is yet another table with columns:

1. User - **Mark 12**
2. Access Level - **Mark 13**
3. Actions **Marks 14 and 15**

Here you can view, add and delete access rights.

## Create Namespace

On top of the page, you can see **Create namespace** button, by clicking on it, you would get a drawer open.
You don't need any special data to create a namespace: just name.

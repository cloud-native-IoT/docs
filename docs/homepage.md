# recasta AIoT cloud

recasta is an opinionated multi-tenant hyperscale cloud to connect IoT devices securely. It features a unique Graph-based authorization system, allowing users & engineers to create arbitrary hierarchical ontologies, with the possibility to scope permissions down to single sub-devices to specific users (e.g. suppliers). It exposes simple to consume RESTful & gRPC APIs with both high-level (e.g. device shadow) and low-level (sending messages) concepts.
